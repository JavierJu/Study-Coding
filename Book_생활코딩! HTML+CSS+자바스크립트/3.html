        <h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가</h2>
        <p><span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level programming <span>language</span> that follows the ECMAScript standard. It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language, and is currently the most popular programming language in use. <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is usually found running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks to large web applications. <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like Node.js, or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks the high-level functionality that <span class="js">JavaScript</span> offers.</p>
